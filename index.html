  <h1>Morphognostic honey bees communicating nectar location through dance movements</h1>
  <h2>Honey bees are social insects that forage for flower nectar cooperatively. When an individual
  forager discovers a flower patch rich in nectar, it returns to the hive and performs a "dance" in 
  the vicinity of other bees that consists of movements communicating the direction and distance to 
  the nectar source. The bees that receive this information then fly to the location of the nectar to 
  retrieve it, thus cooperatively exploiting the environment. This project simulates this behavior in 
  a cellular automaton using the Morphognosis model. The model features hierarchical spatial and temporal 
  contexts that output motor responses from sensory inputs. Given a set of bee foraging and dancing 
  exemplars, and exposing only the external input-output of these behaviors to the Morphognosis learning 
  algorithm, a hive of artificial bees can be generated that forage as their biological counterparts do.</h2>
